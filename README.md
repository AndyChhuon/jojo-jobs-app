## Objective

Develop a job applications website, using AGILE methodology.

## Project

The jobs applications process can be cumbersone in many cases. All Software Engineers have their complaints about having to create a new WorkDay account for every company they apply to. On the employer's side, it is difficult and crucial to find the perfect candidate for open positions.

Jojo seeks to fix this problem, thanks to an algorithm that matches various companies to the best candidates - all under one web application.
